/*
 * This class does all of two way messaging server's job
 * It simultaneously watches both keyboard and socket for input
 *
 * It consists of 2 threads: parent thread (code inside init method)
 * and child thread (code inside run method)
 *
 * Parent thread spawns a child thread and then
 * reads from the socket and writes to the screen
 *
 * Child thread reads from the keyboard and writes to socket
 *
 * Since a thread is being created with this class object,
 * this class declaration includes "implements Runnable"
